The first<span class="ellipsis">...</span><span class="expandable-content">, a 7-day intensive on JAMOVI (January 19-25, 2025), covered fundamental data handling, hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and various statistical tests. Following this, a second workshop (January 28 - February 1, 2025) focused on Experimental Designs using R/JAMOVI/SPSS, encompassing R basics, common experimental designs (CRD, RBD, Split-Plot), ANOVA, and graphical representation of results, including a case study. Our Project Associate, Saumya Dwivedi, attended both workshops, instructed by Dr. D S Dhakre of Statistical Point, gaining valuable skills for analyzing project data.</span> </p>
